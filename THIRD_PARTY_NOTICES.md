# Third-party notices

## DeepSeek Harness

The launcher is designed to run the open-source DeepSeek Harness runtime
(`@deepseek-ai/dsh`) and its official `dsh --profile web` interface:

- Repository: <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness>
- License shown by the upstream repository: MIT
- Runtime package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/dsh>

The source repository does not vendor the Runtime Bundle or its `node_modules`.
Release builds assemble a pinned Runtime Bundle in GitHub Actions. The
upstream repository and the generated dependency tree remain the authoritative
sources for their notices and licenses.

## dsh-llm-codex

The launcher does not copy or embed the `dsh-llm-codex` source. It only supports
installing it through the standard Harness plugin command:

- Repository: <https://github.com/yequ172672/dsh-codex-subscription>
- Package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-llm-codex>

Its license, terms, provider protocol, and ChatGPT subscription behavior are
controlled by that upstream project and must be reviewed there before
redistribution. Installing it is an explicit user action.

## dsh1024

The fresh-install profile pins `dsh1024@0.5.0` (MIT). Reviewed replacements
under `Resources/dsh1024-launcher` disable self-updates and hand installation
to the launcher's native profile transaction. The original license is included.

- Repository: <https://github.com/imsai-sh/awesome-deepseek-harness-plugins/tree/main/packages/dsh1024>
- Adapter scope: `Resources/dsh1024-launcher/NOTICE.md`

## dsh-genui

The fresh-install profile includes `@changfenhuang/dsh-genui@0.9.8`. It adds
the `dsh-ui` output language and the browser renderer for interactive UI
components. The package is MIT-licensed and remains under its upstream
project's terms.

- Repository: <https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-genui>
- Package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@changfenhuang/dsh-genui>

## better-dsh-pet

The fresh-install Runtime profile includes the upstream `better-dsh-pet@0.3.5`
DSH bundle. Windows uses the package's Windows helper through the standard
Harness plugin contract; the launcher only toggles its local configuration
endpoint and does not repackage the helper. The upstream code is MIT-licensed;
the animation assets may carry additional non-commercial and attribution
requirements, so releases preserve the upstream package README and license.

- Upstream repository: <https://github.com/ysppwn721/better-dsh-pet>

## dsh-mnemon and Mnemon Native

The fresh-install Runtime profile includes `dsh-mnemon@0.4.6`, installed
through the standard Harness plugin registry. The Runtime Bundle also carries
the architecture-specific `mnemon` Native CLI `0.2.7`; the release workflow
downloads the official archive and verifies its upstream SHA-256 checksum
before placing it under the App Runtime. The launcher does not install this
binary globally.

- dsh-mnemon repository: <https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-mnemon>
- dsh-mnemon license: MIT
- Mnemon Native repository: <https://github.com/mnemon-dev/mnemon>
- Mnemon Native release: <https://github.com/mnemon-dev/mnemon/releases/tag/v0.2.7>
- Mnemon Native license: MIT

## dsh-privacy-router

The fresh-install Runtime profile includes the Host-side privacy router from a
reviewed upstream Git commit. It is installed but disabled by default because
the router requires a configured local Provider for its privacy boundary. After
the local Provider is configured, users can enable it from the launcher's
installed-plugin menu. The upstream project is MIT-licensed.

- Repository: <https://github.com/LYiHub/pub-dsh-privacy-router>
- Pinned commit: `1b51e6d622eaebaa3b0a3ab51a416cb2499d1251`
- License: MIT

## dsh-mattpocock-skills

The fresh-install Runtime profile includes the launcher-specific
`dsh-mattpocock-skills` bundle. It contains 25 localized engineering and
productivity skills and registers them through DeepSeek Harness's first-party
skill loader. The bundle is pinned to commit
`a1cb9b3a40a3f372406663f50083197dfe110177` so releases do not change when the
upstream branch moves.

- Repository: <https://github.com/engty/dsh-mattpocock-skills>
- Based on: <https://github.com/mattpocock/skills>
- License: MIT

## Other dependencies

Node.js, WPF, WebView2, npm, pnpm, and transitive npm packages are used by the
Windows build or Runtime Bundle. The release workflow pins pnpm and npm inside
the App Runtime; they are not installed globally. Their respective licenses
remain with their authors. A release artifact built with the workflow includes the
Runtime dependency tree; inspect the corresponding upstream package metadata
before redistributing a modified artifact.

The complete Windows bundle may include the x64 Fixed Version WebView2 Runtime:

- Product: Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime
- Distribution guidance: <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/>
- Preparation package: <https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebView2.Runtime.X64>
- The runtime is loaded from the package directory and is not installed machine-wide.

The controlled private-toolchain recovery list currently includes jq 1.7.1:

- Repository: <https://github.com/jqlang/jq>
- License: MIT
- The Launcher downloads only the architecture-specific release asset whose
  URL, size, SHA-256, source, and license are pinned in the application code.
